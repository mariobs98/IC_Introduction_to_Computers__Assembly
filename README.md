# IC_Introduction_to_Computers__Assembly

The main goal of this project is to create an 8086 assembly language program that implements the Master Mind game. 
The purpose of the game is to guess a hidden combination made up of pieces of different colors. 
To do this, the player introduces a possible combination in each move and the program responds by indicating how many pieces are correct in position and how many are only in color. With that information, the player enters a new combination again until he guesses it or exceeds the number of attempts.
